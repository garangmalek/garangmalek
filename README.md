# Hi there, I'm Garang Malek 👋

## About Me

I'm a passionate developer who codes by moonlight and debugs by sunrise. I once refactored a entire codebase while skydiving (don't ask how). I believe every bug is just a feature waiting to be documented.

## 🔭 What I'm Working On

- Building **QuantumToast** - a revolutionary app that predicts when your bread will be perfectly toasted using quantum algorithms
- Contributing to **OpenSourcePizzaTracker** - helping the world track pizza delivery with blockchain
- Exploring **Neural networks trained on cat memes** to improve AI humor

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

**Languages:** JavaScript, Python, Rust, COBOL (yes, really), Brainfuck  
**Frontend:** React, Svelte, jQuery (I'm a rebel), Vanilla JS with 47 polyfills  
**Backend:** Node.js, Deno, Flask, Carrier Pigeons API  
**Database:** PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Excel Spreadsheets, Post-it Notes  
**Tools:** Git, Docker, Kubernetes, Duct Tape, Stack Overflow Premium™  

## 🌱 Currently Learning

- How to center a div (still haven't figured it out after 10 years)
- Competitive origami folding algorithms
- Speaking fluent regex in my sleep

## ⚡ Fun Facts

- I can type 140 WPM but still use two-finger typing
- My rubber duck's name is Gama and he's a better programmer than me
- I once solved a production issue by turning it off and on again (we don't talk about it)
- Coffee-to-code ratio: 5:1
- I have 847 browser tabs open right now and I know what each one is for (I think)

## 🎮 When I'm Not Coding

- Training my AI to generate perfectly balanced D&D campaigns
- Collecting vintage keyboards (currently at 23 and counting)
- Teaching penguins to code in Antarctica (remotely, of course)
